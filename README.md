dotfiles
========

These are the (redacted) contents of my `~/.config` directory, symlinked elsewhere on my system as necessary.

I use OS X at home and Cygwin at work. These files should safely, sanely 
operate on both, degrading and/or failing gracefully where they don't. My
`bash` files are intended for version 4+, and haven't been tested on anything 
older than version 3.2.

Pardon my dust: I'm new to both `git` and GitHub, and still figuring all this 
out.
