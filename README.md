dotfiles
========

These are the (redacted) contents of my `~/.config` directory.

I use OS X at home and Cygwin at work. These files should safely, sanely 
operate on both, degrading and/or failing gracefully where they don't.

I'm new to both `git` and GitHub; your patience is appreciated while I fumble
my way through figuring all this out.
